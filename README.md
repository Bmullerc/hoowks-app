# Hoowks, a Personal Learning Project

## The idea
My idea was to study React Hooks by creating a mock teaching page. With that in mind, I had to research and compile information to be able to explain and create examples while also practicing a lot of other concepts, skills and tools.

### Disclaimer
This is all coming from a student, still grasping a lot of the concepts of front-end development. So, if anything is wrong or missing information, I will fix it. Also, this was heavily inspired by [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/), [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) and [React Official Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) and most of the information was taken from these sources.

## Built With

- React
- Vite
- TailwindCSS
- HeadlessUI
- Semantic HTML5
- Mobile-first workflow
- Accessibility focus

## My Process

- For this project I didn't start with a Figma design, I just designed it on the fly and changed things as I saw fit.
- This really started with a personal test project for a Navbar using Tailwind + Headless with Theme changing in mind, and I just decided to expand it from there since I liked how it looked.
- Decided to go with the "Hoowks" name because it combined How and Hooks. Cheesy, but it does the job.
- As I already had decided on the colors with the Navbar, I then just used the same "feel" in the whole project.
- Made the extravagant Header, with the Logo already in mind with a "?" in its place. Somewhat proud of the gradient into background look.
- Wrote the About and Disclaimer explaining the project.
- Went on to actually start on the content, first with a basic Intro and then going into each of the three basic Hooks.
- As I finished each Hooks, I tried to include self made examples.
- At some point, I had a lot of reused lines caused by Tailwind and little code snippets, which I then replace with a simple `<Code />` component.
- Did the same as above to the `<Pre />` formatted code and HOT TIP, replacing them with a `<PreCode />` and `<HotTip />` components.
- Added some Extra content and a Footer with my socials.
- Created and Added the Logo and Favicon.
- Added a TODO list for the future.
- Also always kept changing and improving on the layout, making adjustments to theme colors, margins, responsiveness and other details as I went.

## Need to Improve

- From these three Hooks, useContext is still not 100% clear in my mind. Need more Practice.

## Next Steps

- Really learn Typescript and then Next.
